# Langchain-with-Python-Bootcamp
These are notebooks from excercises from a Udemy Course.(https://www.udemy.com/course/langchain-with-python-bootcamp/) The course is structured into 4 parts, model input/output, data connections, chains, memory and agents.

These excercises I coded myself:

Model Input/Output excercise - Creating a HistoryQuiz class, that will take a topic as an input, then generates a question and compare the userÂ´s answer with the correct answer generated by AI. I am using Zephyr-7b-beta LLM.

Chains excercise -  creating a customer service AI, that will detect the language by BERT classifier, translate the text to english using Seq2SeqLM and finaly summarize the text. Because of very poor performance of open-source models. The whole task is then recreated with OpenAI GPT-3.5

Data connections excercise -
