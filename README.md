# Langchain-with-Python-Bootcamp
These are notebooks from excercises from a Udemy Course.(https://www.udemy.com/course/langchain-with-python-bootcamp/) The course is structured into 4 parts, model input/output, data connections, chains, memory and agents.
Throughout the course I am using Hugging face Zephyr-7b-beta LLM or OpenAI GPT 3.5

These excercises I coded myself:

**Model Input/Output excercise** - Creating a HistoryQuiz class, that will take a topic as an input, then generates a question and compare userÂ´s answer with the correct answer generated by AI. 

**Chains excercise** -  Creating a customer service AI, that will detect the language by BERT classifier, translate the text to english using Seq2SeqLM and finaly summarize the text. Because of poor performance of open-source models. The whole task is then recreated with OpenAI GPT-3.5

**Data connections excercise** - Reading a txt file, split it into chunks and write it to a ChromaDB vector store. Then use Contextual Compression Retriever to retrieve relevant information from the document.

**Data loading excercise** - Using Wikipedia Loader to answer questions, on information that the model was not trained on.

**SQL Agent** - Loading the SQL database and then trying some queries using SQL Agent with SQLDatabaseToolkit.
